# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Please separate your code changes into meaningful commits. Do not add all of your changes to
   one single commit. Doing so makes reviewing incredibly difficult and increases the chance a bug
   can slip through the review process.
3. Create a pull request and provide a description of what you changed and what effect your changes
   have. If your changes break backward-compatibility, please include that.
4. You may merge your pull request after the approval of one other developer. If you do not have
   permission to do so, your reviewer will do it for you.
5. Please use the "Squash" merge scheme when merging pull requests. This prevents pollution of the
   repository history with redundant merge commits.
